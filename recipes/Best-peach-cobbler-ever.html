        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is the best peach cobbler recipe I have found. It makes a very moist cobbler with juicy sliced peaches that's easy to make and delicious to eat!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul><li>1 (29 ounce) can sliced peaches
        </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
<li>1 pinch ground cinnamon</li>
<li>
    1 pinch ground nutmeg
</li></ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol><li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.) In a large bowl, combine sliced peaches with juice, 2 tablespoons melted butter, a pinch of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. Dissolve cornstarch in water, then stir into peach mixture; set aside.</li>
    <li>Combine milk, sugar, flour, baking powder and salt in another bowl; beat until smooth - the mixture will be thin.</li>
    <li>Melt 1/2 cup butter in a 9x13 inch pan. Pour batter over melted butter. Scoop peaches out of bowl and spoon over batter. Sprinkle top with additional cinnamon and nutmeg.

    </li>
